My Chess Website 

The purpose of this project is to create a website to explain my teaching services to potential students, and to detail my upcoming events.  This website utilizes HTML, CSS, python, and bash.  In the future, I hope to add product purchasing options, login ability, and upload options for my students to submit homework easily.  

To build website, run either build.py or build.sh and run the website form the docs directory.
